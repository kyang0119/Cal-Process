# Cal-Process


create a program “cal.c” or “cal.cpp” to perform some calculations. The input file is
“cal.in”. The file contains 𝑀 + 1 lines. The first line contains a single integer, 𝑀. The following 𝑀 lines are
the computing commands. Each line includes a command and 2 integers. The command can be “quadratic,
“triples”, or “mod-sum”. Function “quadratic” finds the 2 roots of x^2 + ax + b and 𝑎 and 𝑏 are the two
integers given in the same line. Function “triples” finds a list of Pythagorean triples that satisfies 𝑥^2 + 𝑦^2 =
z^2, with 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧 all being integers. The two input integers are the maximum values for 𝑥 and 𝑦. Function
“mod-sum” computes Σ n % mod and 𝑥 and 𝑚𝑜𝑑 are the two integers given in the same line.
The C code for quadratic, triples, and sum functions are given in files “quadratic.c”, “triples.c”, and
“sum.c”, respectively. You just need to implement the main program in another file “cal.c” or “cal.cpp”.
